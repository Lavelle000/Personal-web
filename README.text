What I Did:

This is my personal website project made using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It’s a portfolio that showcases who I am as a freelance artist.

Here are the main features I included:

A homepage with a custom background and intro about me

Navigation bar that works on both desktop and mobile

An About section with my photo and short description

A Skills section that highlights my abilities in traditional and digital art

A Featured Works section (renamed from “Work”) to show some of my actual art pieces

A Contact section with a form and my phone number

Scroll animations using ScrollReveal for smooth transitions

Social media icons that link to my actual Instagram and Facebook pages

Design Choices / Changes from Wireframe:

I replaced the default “blob” art design with a personal background image to better reflect my personality.

Changed the "Work" section to "Featured Works" to fit my art theme better.

Replaced “Photoshop” with "Traditional Art" in the skills section to show what I actually do more often.

Included my real phone number so people can easily contact me.

Used my own art images instead of placeholders in the featured section.

Everything was styled using CSS, and I made sure it looks good on both desktop and mobile.
